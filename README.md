# termbeats — Real-time ASCII Music Visualiser

![demo](demo.gif)

A stunning 40-band music visualiser written in **pure Bash** with zero dependencies.

No audio files • No ffmpeg • No yt-dlp • No internet needed  
Works perfectly in **GitHub CodeSpaces** with one command.

## One-Command Demo

```bash
chmod +x termbeats.sh
./termbeats.sh
```

## Case Study
I needed a portfolio piece that demonstrates advanced Bash skills (loops, math, terminal control) and looks incredible on any recruiter's screen — even on headless servers. This does exactly that.
